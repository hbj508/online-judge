      <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>How do we test whether my solution is correct or not?</strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
Your code is tested by a computer automatically, not by a human being, and you have to write your code accordingly.<br>

For each problem, we will have one or more input files, each according to the specifications mentioned in the problem statement, and corresponding correct output files. we will run your program on each of the input files by redirecting the standard input stream to an input file, and the standard output stream to another file. The output generated by your program must match the correct output exactly in order to be judged correct.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>How does the time limit work</strong>
</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
Time limit can be different for each problem.

This time limit in meant so, that your code have to return correct value for one input file in the limit. Sometimes there is more than one test case in file, then the sum of times per test case have to be lower than time limit

      <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>Why do i get a compile error?</strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
There are a few reasons why your code may compile on your computer but not on platform. In all cases, you can see the compile error by clicking on the Compile Error icon after submitting your code.<br><br>

Java:<br>

Your class containing the main method must be a public class called Main. It may not be called anything else. Do not use packages.<br><br>

C/C++:<br>

Make sure you are using a compiler that complies with the standards. Turbo C++ is not such a compiler, and often code which compiles in Turbo C++ will not compile on CodeChef.<br><br>

Make sure you are using standard headers. Do not use conio.h in C; this is not part of the C standard library. Do not use iostream.h; this is a deprecated header file and again is not a standard library. (You should just be using iostream instead).<br><br><br><br>
      </p></div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>Why do I get Wrong Answer?</strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
Wrong answer means simply that - your program is not printing out the correct answer. You will just have to debug your program very carefully! Make sure your program is conforming exactly to the output format required, and not printing out unnecessary information, as mentioned at the start of this FAQ.
    </p></div>
    </li>


    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>Why do I get a Time Limit Exceeded?</strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
To understand Time Limit Exceeded(TLE), understanding how the online judge works will help. The online judge allocates resources like memory and CPU for evaluating every submission. However, to ensure that your submission does not keep running for an infinite time, the online judge has to stop your submission from running after a particular time period. This time period is actually decided by the problem setter and is given as one of the inputs to the online judge. Once the submission program runs for time period the judge system issues a system kill command to the program execution and assigns TLE result to the submission.<br><br>

The most common reason that you would get a TLE is because your program is too slow. If a problem tells you that N <= 100000, and your program has nested loops each which go up to N, your program will never be fast enough. Read the bounds in the input carefully before writing your program, and try to figure out which inputs will cause your program to run the slowest.<br><br>

The second most common cause of TLE is that your method of reading input and writing output is too slow. In Java, do not use a Scanner; use a BufferedReader instead. In C++, do not use cin/cout - use scanf and printf instead.<br>
